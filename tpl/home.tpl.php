            <p><em>A manifesto for entrepreneurship and innovation to power growth in the European Union.</em></p>

            <p>That’s what nine wildly successful European entrepreneurs – founders and 
                co-founders of eight fast-growing, cutting-edge, globally competitive 
                Internet startups – set out to write in 2013. In a 14-page roadmap 
                containing 22 action points, the Manifesto called on European leaders 
                to do more to make it easier for European startups to thrive right here 
                in Europe. And to date, more than 8,000 people have signed the Manifesto, 
                which has grown into a trans-European campaign and spawned more than 10 
                national startup manifestoes in the European Union member states.
            </p>

            <p>But the question remains: how are the 28 members of the European Union 
                doing on implementing the measures proposed in the Manifesto? To find 
                out, we created the <strong>Startup Manifesto Policy Tracker</strong>
                – an online tool 
                for tracking implementation. The Tracker translates the 22 specific 
                recommendations in the Startup Manifesto into concrete policies whose 
                implementation – or non-implementation – can be observed and followed. 
                The intention is to shed light on what is or isn’t happening at the 
                member-state level – and to inspire action when and where it counts.
            </p>

            <p>But we are counting on you. Like Europe itself, this is a crowdsourced 
                project, whose ultimate success or failure will ride on our 
                capacity to embrace the future and make things happen today. 
                If you haven’t already signed the manifesto, please do. And if you 
                have already signed, please find out what’s being done about it in your 
                local community – and if the answer is “not much,” please ask people to 
                do more – and tell us. We’ll incorporate your answers into the Startup 
                Manifesto Policy Tracker. At the end of the day, it’s your input and 
                insight that will drive change – and make this project a success.
            </p>

            <p>To see how your country is doing, click on the Interactive map, 
                which will take you to a home country summary page. There, you will 
                find an overview text and a dashboard that spells out concrete action 
                – or inaction – in six priority areas.
            </p>

            <p>To take part in this cutting-edge effort to deliver change at the
                grassroots level and report on progress (or inaction) at the 
                member-state level, please contact your national expert 
                or tell us directly about action in the country you know best 
                through the comments field on each country page. 
                Don’t be shy. It’s your Europe. Let’s make it the best home 
                that we can.

            <h3>About Startup Manifesto </h3>

            <p>The Startup Manifesto is a manifesto for entrepreneurship and innovation 
                to power growth in the European Union. This ambitious policy document 
                was written by the Leaders Club, an independent group of founders 
                of world-leading technology companies based in Europe, including 
                Atomico, HackFwd, Rovio, Seedcamp, Spotify, Tech City Investment 
                Organisation (TCIO), Tuenti and The Next Web. The manifesto was 
                drafted to spur discussion on improving the startup ecosystem and 
                digital-era performance in the European Union’s 28 member states.
