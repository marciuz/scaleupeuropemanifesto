INSERT INTO `country` VALUES (1,'Austria','AT','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/austria_flag.gif','Recent years have seen Austria – and in particular Vienna – evolve from an entrepreneurial desert to a promising home for young startups. Still, despite the improving infrastructure and growing awareness of entrepreneur-driven issues (aided by successful local exits and flourishing business angels), there is a lack of venture capital for follow-up financing – and of the right entrepreneurial spirit. One of the initiatives to promote entrepreneurship in Austria is Pioneers Festival, an annual event gathering startups, investors, and technology-driven corporations with a specific focus on Europe, especially Central and Eastern Europe. Labour costs are also high, due to payroll-taxes and health insurance costs, but perhaps the biggest issue for entrepreneurs is a lack of real tax incentives for startups and startup investors. There are some political initiatives to adapt current law to modern day requirements. The government has recently presented its digital strategy, which echoes several suggestions of the Startup Manifesto',1,1,1),(2,'Belgium','BE','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/belgium_flag.gif','Belgium is home to a vibrant, active and fast growing startup scene. Startup Weekends, Hackathlons, Café Numériques, Meetups, Open Coffees and other events are very common in every part of the country. Every large town has its own acceleration programme; and co-working spaces are mushrooming. In early 2015, a group of successful Belgian entrepreneurs launched the Belgian Startup Manifesto. And a few months later, Alexander de Croo, deputy prime minister and minister of development co-operation, digital agenda, telecom and postal services, announced a bold plan to give entrepreneurs extra benefits to grow their new venture. The policies will focus on making crowdfunding easier and keeping lower labour costs for startups. This commitment to innovation is an opening move and is expected to impact upon the local entrepreneurial scene. A Startup Plan to Stimulate Growth for Newly-Formed Companies is a concrete first step to encourage young and beginning entrepreneurs to set up new businesses in innovative sectors. The plan provides more accessible financing, such as a tax shelter for startups, tax incentives for crowdfunding, and lower labour costs for newly formed companies. SMEs and microenterprises investing in digital will also receive incentives.',1,1,1),(3,'Bulgaria','BG','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/bulgaria_flag.gif','The startup ecosystem in Bulgaria has emerged recently and is evolving significantly. Thanks to coworking spaces such as Betahaus, SOHO and CowOrKing as well as local venture funds (LAUNCHub and Eleven) – boosted by investment through the Joint European Resources for Micro and Medium Enterprises (JEREMIE) programme of the European Investment Fund – the startup ecosystem is growing. Several international venture capital funds and strong angel investors backed local companies and there are a few dozen global success stories today. The boom of information-technology outsourcing, hardware and software solutions opened the eyes of a lot of international companies, resulting in a rising reputation for Bulgaria as an excellent source of bright minds. These developments activated entrepreneurship, as many professionals with years of corporate experience started their own ventures and were motivated to reach international recognition and investment. But there is still a long way to go to implement all recommendations of the Startup Manifesto.',1,1,1),(4,'Cyprus','CY','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/cyprus_flag.gif','The government of Cyprus has implemented some policy initiatives in line with the Startup Manifesto recommendations, with the pro-active support of authors of the inspiring national startup manifesto. The country has incorporated the national startup manifesto in the National Policy Statement for Entrepreneurship ratified by the Council of Ministers in December 2015, a concise action plan. Since then, Cyprus rightly positions itself as a good place for any startup to be at the beginning of their lifecycle, as you get the benefit of five times cheaper running and living costs than most other major cities. With a thriving and buzzing supportive ecosystem under the umbrella of Startup Cyprus, Cyprus is evolving into a hot European startup ecosystem driving change, supported by a liberal economy with competitive startup and investment incentives. Its small size makes minimum viable products testing really lean and mean, while funding carries organisations longer with significantly lower rental prices and availability of highly educated talent well versed in English.',1,1,1),(5,'Czech Republic','CZ','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/czechrepublic_flag.gif','Startups play an important role in the Czech economy, where they are known to quickly innovate, find market gaps and create new jobs. The Czech Republic is popular for skilled and relatively cheap information-technology skills, especially among big corporations (e.g. Novartis established its global information and communications technology hub in Prague). But many interesting young companies have also been born there – GoodData, Socialbakers, Cognitive Security, to name a few. The Czech government acknowledges the critical importance of tech entrepreneurship and the pivotal role of startups for the economy. CzechInvest, a government agency, runs accelerator, incubation and mentorship programmes. Recently, CzechInvest launched a new website portal CzechStartups.org. Under one roof, it provides information on incubation possibilities, contacts and consulting as well as possibilities of financing. There are several strong private incubation and venture-capital funds.',1,1,1),(6,'Denmark','DK','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/denmark_flag.gif','Denmark has produced some of the hottest tech startups on the planet. The capital, Copenhagen, is vibrant. Many exciting programmes have been established to promote entrepreneurship. ICT is widely taught in educational institutions. The national government leads Startup Denmark, an initiative to promote entrepreneurship and startups. It is meant as a gateway for talented foreign entrepreneurs to Denmark’s vast startup opportunities, such as accelerators, co-working spaces, investment funds, research centres, as well as grassroots initiatives.',1,1,1),(7,'Estonia','EE','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/estonia_flag.gif','Estonia has highly developed e-government and a business-friendly environment. The country has made progress in promoting entrepreneurship and providing support to fast-growing innovative firms, and it has the potential to become a strong startup hub. Its e-services, mobile communications and Internet applications are among the most progressive in the world. Estonians are adaptable towards new technologies, and use them willingly. The large number of foreign investors doing business in Estonia and the dominance of world-renowned foreign companies in several economic sectors is evidence of the country’s high investment attractiveness. This small Baltic nation is home to around 400 startups, and the number is set to grow. Recently, the Estonian government launched Startup Estonia. The aim is to boost the development of the Estonian startup ecosystem with training activities to support the emergence and development of startup companies and improve their accessibility for “smart money.” The mission and objectives are consistent with the objectives of the Startup Manifesto.',1,1,1),(8,'Finland','FI','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/finland_flag.gif','Just a few years ago, the Finnish startup ecosystem was relatively small and inward-looking. Now it is drawing in the brightest high-tech minds and most innovative companies from around the world. The startup scene in Finland has given birth to two “unicorns” (startups whose valuation exceeds the value of €1 billion) – Rovio (Angry Birds) and Supercell. Since 2009, more than 200 gaming startups have set up shop in Finland. The trend can be attributed to the successes of Nokia’s mobile and tech innovations, now carried on by hundreds of ex-employees. ICT is strongly embedded in the Finnish education system that excels in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects. Helsinki is home to Slush, an annual mega conference where thousands of startups showcase their products to investors and media. Historically, Finland hasn’t had a strong culture of serial entrepreneurship and the access to risk capital has been very limited. That is changing now: there is an influx of local venture capital funds and an increase in direct investment from international venture capitalists. One of the players helping local startups is Tekes, a state-run funding agency that provided funding to Rovio and Supercell.',1,1,1),(9,'France','FR','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/france_flag.gif','A buoyant legislative movement around tech entrepreneurship started in France a few years ago, engaging a vibrant and energetic community of entrepreneurs, technology geeks and policymakers. Launched in 2013, La French Tech is aimed at fostering and supporting a collective movement around the startup ecosystem. It is financed by the French Economy Ministry and supported at the highest political level. The fact that the policymakers are already strongly engaging with the startup community probably explains why there is no national startup manifesto; a diagnosis has already been made and political leaders understand it’s a priority to make France a “startup nation.” Thus, the emphasis is now on legislative actions and implementation of a startup–friendly environment. On 26 January 2016, the French National Assembly adopted a law “Towards the Digital Republic.” Axelle Lemaire, minister of state for digital affairs, introduced the bill, which was the product of a large public consultation. It intends to tackle many of the uncertainties faced by tech startups and to simplify rules.',1,1,1),(10,'Germany','DE','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/germany_flag.gif','Germany’s thriving startup scene is one of the most unique in Europe. The capital Berlin is home to a mixture of tech entrepreneurs, digital startups, experts and scientists that are making waves in the technology scene. A large and growing number of co-working spaces, accelerators, incubators, innovation labs and entrepreneurship programmes provide the infrastructure for creative ideas to flourish and develop into successful new businesses. The challenge for entrepreneurship in Germany is a low tolerance for failure. According to the 2014 edition of the German Startup Monitor, 63.3% of startup entrepreneurs say this attitude is widespread in German society. Still, startups create jobs and contribute to growth. The country is home to unicorns like Delivery Hero, Home24, Rocket Internet and Zalando. The German government has highlighted their support for startups in their “High-Tech Strategy,” recognising the importance of startups to support today’s and tomorrow’s needs for research and development to sustain economic wellbeing.',1,1,1),(11,'Greece','EL','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/greece_flag.gif','As the authors of the Greek Startup Manifesto – the first national startup manifesto – put it, the Greek economy has experienced an unprecedented collapse since 2009, resulting in a gross domestic product decrease by almost 30% (the greatest for any European country in peace time), unemployment of 28% and youth unemployment as high as 65%. For Greece to recover, the country needs to achieve high growth rates – rates which no traditional economic activity promises to provide in short and medium term. Technology-enabled businesses, and especially highly innovative startup companies offering disruptive solutions with global reach, are well positioned to generate growth and employment. Greece is today definitely not the country of choice for startups for a variety of reasons. Among the most important is a complex and volatile tax framework as well as excessive bureaucracy and digital infrastructure that lags behind the EU average.',1,1,1),(12,'Hungary','HU','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/hungary_flag.gif','Hungary’s capital Budapest is one of the most attractive metropolitan cities in Europe, and it also has a young, blossoming startup scene. Several successful Hungarian companies – Ustream, Prezi and LogMeIn – managed to build exceptional products and enter global markets. These startups are a big inspiration to a lot of people and had a significant impact on the startup culture emerging in Hungary. The startup scene is just awakening and the ecosystem in Budapest has only started its growth. As it evolves, it fosters new ideas and ways of doing business, and it makes it easier for aspiring young talent to get enthusiastic about starting a business. A startup ecosystem of accelerators, funding sources and coworking spaces is also emerging.',1,1,1),(13,'Ireland','IE','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/ireland_flag.gif','Ireland, whose growing economy has had the highest growth rate in the eurozone in recent quarters, has been generating a lot of buzz in the startup community recently. Many of the international tech giants – such as Facebook, Google and Twitter – have European headquarters there and cities like Dublin are ablaze with startups. Uber recently announced that it will open a centre of excellence in Limerick that will initially generate 150 jobs and enable the city to further promote itself as a smart hub. Irish entrepreneurs have enthusiastically committed to creating a Startup Manifesto for Ireland in advance of hosting the Startup Nations Summit in Ireland in November 2016 (this is the first time this conference will take place in Europe). Startup Ireland, representing the Irish startup sector, aims to make Ireland the best place in the world to establish a high-growth startup by 2020. Ireland’s startup ecosystem seems to be at a phase of network growth where individual pockets of excellence are increasing in density and starting to connect with each other nationally. Arguably, this process could be accelerated by further adoption of the triple-helix model – deepening university, business and government collaboration with high-growth startups.',1,1,1),(14,'Italy','IT','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/italy_flag.gif','Since 2012, Italy – the second manufacturing country in the European Union and the fifth in the world – has endowed itself with a powerful arsenal of legislation aimed at strengthening the national startup ecosystem. The groundbreaking Italian Startup Act provides the following: 1) Italian startups can be incorporated online and for free; 2) they are exempted from any fee otherwise due to the Chambers of Commerce; 3) they have a free-of-charge access to an online, bilingual, tailor-made platform for national and foreign investors, called #ItalyFrontiers; 4) the team can be paid with variable performance-based salaries; 5) employees and consultants can be remunerated with stock options and work for equity tools, taxed only in the event of capital gain; 6) they can raise money in exchange for shares through equity crowdfunding campaigns (this is the first ad hoc regulation in the world); 7) startups get access to free, automatic public guarantee on bank loans; 8) they benefit from robust tax relief on equity investment made by individuals (19% tax credit up to a maximum investment of €500,000) or legal entities (20% fiscal deduction up to a maximum investment of €1.8 million); 9) in case things go wrong, startups benefit from a fail-fast mechanism. Recently, the Investment Compact Decree has extended most of the benefits previously attributable just to innovative startups to a broader range of companies.',1,1,1),(15,'Latvia','LV','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/latvia_flag.gif','A former Soviet republic, this Baltic state is an otherwise dynamic and vibrant economy whose growth has been fuelled by foreign direct investment. Now Latvia rediscovers entrepreneurship. In 2015, the Latvian startup community platform “Labs of Latvia” was officially launched. The platform provides information from and about Latvian startups to the world. Its database includes more than 100 Latvian startups, investors and communities. The 2015 Latvian presidency of the Council of the European Union was crucial too. Riga hosted #InnoWeek2015 – “First Innovative Enterprise Week,” with a focus on access to finance for research, innovation and SMEs. The conference brought together EU policymakers and Baltic startup scene representatives. Despite these positive developments, the country still faces many challenges in adopting Startup Manifesto-based recommendations.',1,1,1),(16,'Lithuania','LT','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/lithuania_flag.gif','When it comes to startups, this tiny country of three million is starting to make a name for itself. There are more than 100 annual events, meetups, hackathons and workshops in Lithuania. Among those gathering the most participants yearly are LOGIN (attracting more than 80 speakers and 3500 visitors from all over the world), StartupWeekend Lithuania and SV2B. Currently there are several co-working spaces: Hub Vilnius, StartupHighway X, Namas Hub, Sunrise Valley and Talent Garden Kaunas. Lithuania offers the lowest corporate profit tax rate among its neighbours. It has about 1.5 million people in its labour force, including 26,000 IT professionals. Half of all Lithuanians have higher education and are fluent in at least two foreign languages. Lithuania has a very low cost of living, with labour running roughly a quarter of the EU average. Enterprise Lithuania, a state agency tasked with supporting the establishment and development of competitive businesses in Lithuania, runs the Startup Lithuania initiative. It aims to foster the Lithuanian startup ecosystem by providing consultancy, mentoring, matchmaking with venture capital funds and improving the political and economic environment for startups to flourish.',1,1,1),(17,'Luxembourg','LU','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/luxembourg_flag.gif','The startup community in Luxembourg is wide, dynamic and international. The country boasts a stable business environment and political system as well as easy access to administrations and government and favourable taxation environment. Businesses have access to good digital infrastructure. The Luxembourg Entrepreneur and Startup Community has quickly become one of the fastest-growing communities made up entirely of entrepreneurs, investors and startup aficionados. Hundreds of members have joined the network and attended the numerous meetups organised each month, with early adopters, techies, entrepreneurs, investors and others. On the government side, LuxInnovation, a state-run agency, provides support to startups and other innovative businesses. “Fit for Start” supports startups in their establishment phase by offering early-stage funding and coaching. The aim of the programme is to improve the startup conditions for young innovative enterprises in the ICT sector.',1,1,1),(18,'Malta','MT','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/malta_flag.gif','Malta is a stable eurozone economy, offering a safe business environment, friendly taxation and good business ownership regulation. For startup companies, Malta offers a history of small enterprise, a vibrant location with a workforce of young naturally English-speaking graduates. Startup Weekend Malta is a 54-hour event that brings together designers, developers, entrepreneurs, and experts from all domains. All Startup Weekend events follow the same basic model: anyone is welcome to pitch their startup idea and receive feedback from their peers. Teams form around the top ideas (as determined by popular vote) and embark on a three-day frenzy of business model creation, coding, designing, and market validation. The weekend culminates with presentations in front of local entrepreneur leaders with an opportunity for critical feedback. On the government side, state-owned Malta Enterprise provides support to startups and dynamic businesses, including financial support, seeking to implement the Startup Manifesto recommendations. Malta’s recently launched Digital Strategy echoes the Startup Manifesto and translates its recommendations into specific national policy priorities.',1,1,1),(19,'Netherlands','NL','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/netherlands_flag.gif','The Netherlands is a relatively small country with a relatively large entrepreneurial impact. It all happens in 10+ leading innovation hubs that are 90 minutes apart – giving entrepreneurs access to top talent, technology and ecosystems to help them grow their business. The Netherlands is a fast-changing, dynamic economy that presents opportunities to all entrepreneurs, innovators and great minds who think on an international scale. Startups, such as Booking.com and Adyen, are changing the way we travel and pay. The Netherlands has a unique proposition as a “testbed” and “launch pad” for startups and scale-ups. Dutch consumers are also very open to change and tech savvy. To give an extra boost, the government has initiated the StartupDelta initiative: a dedicated team with excellent connections in enterprise, government, research and all aspects of the startup community. StartupDelta, led by Special Envoy Neelie Kroes, former European Commission vice-president for the digital agenda, closely collaborates with the innovation hubs to make the Netherlands the leading startup ecosystem in Europe. To support the European initiative in this area, local entrepreneurs launched the Dutch Startup Manifesto.',1,1,1),(20,'Poland','PL','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/poland_flag.gif','Entrepreneurship has deep roots in Poland, and has helped the country achieve a level of independence and relative strength over the years. There is an ever increasing number of innovative companies which strengthen and develop the Polish startup ecosystem. Successes achieved in complex industries like biotechnology and programming demonstrate the unlimited potential of Polish talent. However, in order to fully utilise this capacity, there is a need for an ecosystem that supports innovation in Poland. The country is well on the way of implementing the recommendations of the Startup Manifesto. Importantly, this work is supported by the national Startup Poland association and echoed in Poland Startup Manifesto.',1,1,1),(21,'Portugal','PT','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/portugal_flag.gif','After several years of economic hardship, Portugal is witnessing a real entrepreneurial boom, as more young people are choosing to start their own business. This has resulted in an explosive growth in the number of startups. To boost entrepreneurship even more, the Portuguese government created an investment agency called Portugal Ventures, a €450 million fund focusing on investments in innovative, scientific and technology-based companies. In the last year several Portuguese startups – such as Aptoide, Anubisnetworks, Feedzai, OutSystems, Talkdesk, Unbabel, Uniplaces and Veniam – raised significant amounts of international capital (more than €150 million in total). Moreover, the new government just announced a new strategy named Startup Portugal, that will include a very ambitious programme of investment tax incentives and matching funds for business angels and venture capital, along with a strong focus on accelerators and incubation networks, and incentives for startups and innovation. A number of startup incubators have been established, offering new businesses an office or desk to get them off the ground. Startup Lisboa, for example, one of the largest incubators in the country, hosts around 80 startups at any one time from various areas of business, from tech to tourism and everything in between. Based in Lisbon, Beta-i is an organisation with the mission to improve entrepreneurship through creating and boosting a network of entrepreneurship, accelerating startups with global ambition (over 550 in the last five years) and facilitating their access to investment (over €50 million raised). In June 2014, Beta-i was recognised as the biggest startup and entrepreneurship promoter in Europe by the European Enterprise Promotion Awards.',1,1,1),(22,'Romania','RO','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/romania_flag.gif','Romania’s troubled past and extremes of economic hardship have given rise to an enforced entrepreneurial culture of self-sufficiency and resilience, which has spawned a strengthening business sector, a wealth of technical skills and resources and a flourishing startup community. A strong culture of programming, innovation and incubation is emerging. Universities in Bucharest, Timișoara, Cluj-Napoca, Iași and Constanța provide a regular source of talented people and drive tech innovation. The Romanian startup ecosystem now boasts numerous incubators, co-working spaces and dedicated events to help emerging entrepreneurs. National startup figures are modest, but growing. However there are barriers to business growth including a lack of startup funding, bank lending and equity investment, as well as a relatively small domestic consumer market.',1,1,1),(23,'Slovakia','SK','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/slovakia_flag.gif','Slovaks are natural problem solvers, and the forefathers of the Slovak tech scene started to work on their first business ventures not long after the collapse of communism in 1989. A big advantage is the small size of the country. Everyone knows everyone, and mentors, angel investors and venture capitalists are easily approachable at various events. It is also a great test market for business-to-business products as one can easily meet top-level executives and corporate partners. SAPIE (The Slovak Alliance for Internet Economy), a major driver of the innovative and Internet economy in the country, was formed two years ago with over 40 members ranging from multinational players to domestic business icons. Slovak President Andrej Kiska – a former serial entrepreneur himself – avidly promotes an innovation agenda that would unite ecosystems with a strong vision. In 2015, the Slovak government in co-operation with SAPIE prepared and passed the first wave of pro-startup legislation. Among the key elements are new forms of enterprise structure tailored for the needs of high-growth companies, a plan for tax incentives and support for angel investors.',1,1,1),(24,'Slovenia','SI','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/slovenia_flag.gif','Startup companies and the high-tech industry in Slovenia are growing and expanding. Unfortunately, it still happens on a small scale, and the impact on the overall Slovenian economy is limited. The Slovenian startup ecosystem is still fragile and fragmented. The country has developed a framework for general support to entrepreneurship but it doesn’t yet bring as many results as it could, as there is still no differentiation between entrepreneurship and startups, and tailored startup-oriented measures are lacking. Some foundations of a national startup ecosystem have been developed but still more has to be done. Local entrepreneurs have produced a Slovenian Startup Manifesto – a national roadmap in support of the (European) Startup Manifesto. Over the course of the next five years, the initiative aims to create hundreds of new jobs in startups, to connect at least 50 startups with the most important startup ecosystems in the world and to create or attract high-impact startups with global potential.',1,1,1),(25,'Spain','ES','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/spain_flag.gif','Some 89% of employment in Spain is generated by companies with 20 employees – or less. And yet, the Spanish startup ecosystem lacks connection between different initiatives as well as useful and objective information about available resources. Furthermore, since the ecosystem is so young, there is a large disproportion of experienced and unskilled entrepreneurs. The Spanish entrepreneurial ecosystem has made a lot of progress in the last couple of years. However, there are still some individual and cultural elements that damage entrepreneurial activity and affect personal and corporate decision making processes. To drive the much-needed change, a group of entrepreneurs launched the Spanish Startup Manifesto in support of the Startup Manifesto.',1,1,1),(26,'Sweden','SE','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/sweden_flag.gif','Sweden is one of the most competitive economies in the world with a strong business environment and an efficient public administration. The country has a large and diversified export market reaching beyond Europe. Sweden is – paradoxically enough – the second best country in the world when it comes to producing modern billion-dollar startups. Only Silicon Valley beats Stockholm when it comes to unicorns per capita. But this refers to only a handful of companies. Ninety-nine percent of all companies in Sweden are small businesses and today they account for four of five jobs. This is not reflected in Sweden’s politics where the focus lies on big corporations, and where the biggest slice of state funds are allocated to mature companies and regional policy regulations, with a very slim investment in, and understanding of, new and growing businesses. To overcome this problem, leading Swedish entrepreneurs have joined forces to promote the Startup Manifesto. They produced the Swedish Startup Manifesto with an ambitious goal – to make Sweden the most startup-friendly country in the world where many young companies can grow, thrive and stay.',1,1,1),(27,'United Kingdom','UK','http://europa.eu/about-eu/member-countries/countries/images/unitedkingdom_flag.gif','The United Kingdom is an advanced, high-income market economy. The services sector dominates the UK economy, contributing up to 80% of its gross domestic product; the financial services industry is particularly important. The United Kingdom also has one of the most vital startup ecosystems worldwide. A vibrant cultural scene, an international workforce and a wide network of tech hubs and accelerators also help London continue to attract young businesses. The national government is business-oriented and seeks to create a startup-friendly climate in the country. In September 2014, the Coalition for a Digital Economy (COADEC) launched the UK Startup Manifesto, to support the Startup Manifesto and translate its recommendations into country-specific initiatives. It has been backed by over 200 leading startups and investors, including founders and partners from King, TransferWise, SwiftKey, Lovestruck, Funding Circle, MOO, Index Ventures, Passion Capital, Seedcamp and Accel Partners. The UK Startup Manifesto sets out 24 ways the government can make the UK a world leader on digital innovation.',1,1,1),(100,'European Commission','EC','../img/flags/ec.jpg','',0,1,2),(103,'Startups','SUP','','',0,1,3),(104,'Ecosystem players','ECO','','',0,1,4);

The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has developed an ICT framework which sets out a structured approach to ICT in curriculum and assessment. This sets out the types of learning appropriate for students during the period of compulsory education, and provides a guide to teachers for embedding ICT across the curriculum. The overall implementation of ICT in schools is supported by the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) which provides for extensive training and guidance for schools on the integration of ICT into teaching and learning. To further support teachers in using ICT in the curriculum, the NCCA developed the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in the Primary School Curriculum: Guidelines for Teachers as a supporting document to the Primary School Curriculum 1999. The guidelines were launched by the Department of Education and Science in 2004. At post-primary level, one of the Statements of Learning in the Framework for Junior Cycle reform is to ensure that all students \"Use ICT effectively and ethically in learning and in life\". The forthcoming Junior Cycle reform will allow for the introduction of optional school developed short courses of 100 hours duration. This will provide opportunities for schools to progress the provision of courses to enhance students\' ICT skills which will be embedded in all their learning. One of the objectives of junior cycle reform is to promote increased creativity and innovation, to create space for active learning, and to better embed key skills such as ICT, teamwork and communications. It is envisaged that the existing range of subjects in junior certificate will be continued, supported by more flexible forms of assessment. Each student would have to complete 24 statements of learning, which include communicating, creating, appreciating and interpreting texts, including written, oral, visual, and other texts, using technologies to meet a design challenge, applying practical skills to develop models and products using a variety of materials and technologies, and using ICT effectively and ethically in learning and life. There is also a Transition Year option in relation to \"Having Fun with Computer Programming and Games\" and, under the ICT Action Plan this is being expanded nationally. Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) are also significant components in the syllabuses of Technology and Design and Communication Graphics. E-learning is present across the education system: -        Consideration is currently being given to providing the national curricula in an e-book format to teachers. -        Many schools now have their own Virtual Learning Environment whereby a collection of integrated tools enables the management of online learning. The system can include student tracking, assessment and access to digital resources. -        Many of the PDST ICT courses are now available on line for teachers. - In relation to vocational training e-learning is part of the content of courses provided under the range of Further Education full-time and part-time options. •        In the Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) programme, over 50% of courses are either IT courses or courses with high IT content. •        Under VTOS, 280 places are provided in the Dublin region for training long-term unemployed adults through Fast-track to Information Technology (FIT). This includes the provision of specialised IT staff for the programme. •        Through the Back to Education Initiative (BTEI), the Department provides funding for part time learning opportunities for adults. ICT courses feature prominently within BTEI provision. •        Under the Adult Literacy scheme, VECs also provide classes in basic IT tuition and learning through the use of computers. Under Community Education, computer classes, language classes and hobby type courses are funded mainly through the provision of tutor hours. - FÁS Training Specifications are amended for delivery through Blended Learning and Online Learning and are available nationally.\nCoding integrated in school curriculum.

This definition is a practical one that highlights the interaction required for learning to occur. Through technologies and digital content, eLearning in primary and secondary schools ought to enhance the teaching and learning processes, the interaction among peers, and interactions between students and teachers. eLearning in the primary and secondary schools is driven by the need for increased access to learning which can be facilitated through: Section 2: Principles, Aims and Learning Areas 46 Consultation Document 2: Rationale and Components • a shift to constructivist education philosophies; • a move from teacher to student-centred learning activities; • accessing both local and global resources; • making full use of the potential of technologies to enable children to show and create knowledge; and • an increased complexity of tasks and use of multi-modal information. Furthermore the NCF’s 1st principle in the six general principles states that “every child is entitled to a quality education experience” and thus entitled to contemporary learning approaches, including e-learning. Hence, the NCF promotes, among other aims that can be achieved with technology, learning programmes that empower teachers to implement innovative teaching/learning strategies through the use of eLearning.\n\nIn primary education, ICT is not taught as a separate subject but is integrated in a cross-curricular approach, mainly based on the use of e-Learning tools.

The discharge process in Portugal is automatic and rather swift. However, there remains a stigma associated with failure which could be countered through information campaigns showcasing successful entrepreneurs who previously faced bankruptcy. http://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/business-friendly-environment/performance-review/files/countries-sheets/2015/portugal_en.pdf','2017-02-12 12:06:00',38,1),(446,24,1,57,'Some progress has been made in recent years.
